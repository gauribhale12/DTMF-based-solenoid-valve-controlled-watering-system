# DTMF-based-solenoid-valve-controlled-watering-system

This project employs the Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) technique to regulate water flow through a solenoid valve, providing an efficient and versatile solution. Utilizing soil moisture as a crucial environmental parameter, it intelligently determines when and how much water should be supplied to plants and crops. This system offers both automatic and manual operation modes, catering to various needs. Whether for domestic applications like managing backyard and terrace garden watering systems or for larger-scale agricultural purposes, this adaptable system offers a reliable and convenient way to ensure optimal water supply, promoting healthy growth and conservation of this vital resource.
